# Gotty-Remake

Welcome to Gotty-Remake, a project by Foxytouxxx that takes the classic Gotty tool to the next level! ðŸš€

## How it Works

Gotty-Remake transforms your command-line tools into interactive web applications. Here's a quick breakdown of how it works:

1. **Docker Setup:**
   - Pulls the Ubuntu 20.04 base image.
   - Installs necessary dependencies and tools, including curl.
   - Downloads and extracts the Gotty binary from the specified release using the provided tag version.

2. **Script Execution:**
   - Copies the `run_gotty.sh` script into the Docker image.
   - Grants executable permissions to the script.

3. **Expose Port:**
   - Exposes port 8080 to make the web interface accessible.

4. **Command Execution:**
   - Sets the default command to run the `/run_gotty.sh` script when the container starts.
